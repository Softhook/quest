# üè∞ Dungeon Quest: A Hybrid Board & Digital Dungeon Crawler

## 1. Overview
**Dungeon Quest** is a cooperative, family-friendly dungeon crawler board game enhanced by a digital Dungeon Master built in **p5.js**.  
Players explore a physical dungeon map while the digital component generates rooms, monsters, treasures, and story events.

The goal is to balance **imaginative storytelling**, **tactile play**, and **simple digital assistance** ‚Äî creating a magical, child-accessible adventure experience.

## 5. Art & Aesthetic

|----------|--------|

## 6. Storytelling Approach

- Short narrative snippets for each room (1‚Äì2 sentences).
- Tone: playful adventure (‚ÄúYou find a talking cat who offers a riddle.‚Äù).
- Choices can be binary or randomised by dice rolls.
- Occasional ‚Äúchapter‚Äù breaks where the DM narrates story progress.

## 7. System Design (Digital)

### Data Structures
- **Rooms:** type, exits, encounter type, description.
- **Monsters:** name, HP, attack, image path.
- **Events:** story prompts, dialogue, or puzzles.

### Logic Flow
1. Player requests new room.
2. System checks available exits and generates a new room.
3. Adds room to map (grid coordinates).
4. Randomly selects encounter (monster, event, treasure).
5. Displays visual + stats + short text.
6. Waits for player input or combat resolution.
7. Updates state and saves progress.

---

## 8. Rules Summary (Physical Play)

- Players each have **a character** with:
  - **Health Points (HP)**
  - **Attack Value (Dice Roll)**
  - **Special Ability** (optional)
- **Combat Example:**
  - Player rolls 1d6 and adds Attack Value.
  - If total ‚â• Monster Defense, monster loses HP.
  - Monster attacks on DM‚Äôs digital prompt.
- **Movement:** Players decide direction; DM reveals new room.
- **Victory:** Defeat final boss or complete quest objective.
